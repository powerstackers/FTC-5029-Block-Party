==================
Code for  the Powerstackers (FTC #5029) 2013-2014 season, _Block Party_
----
These files include all the tele-op and autonomous code that we use. Most of it won't be of any use to anyone else, though there are some helpful examples and useful functions buried in there. This year, we focused a lot on portability and modularity, making sure that everything could be used more than one way. Most of the functions in our /autonomous-includes folder could be useful, and there's a lot of neat functions buried in there.

All of our code is free to use, share, and edit.
